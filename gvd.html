                        When it comes to communicating with your friends, an easy to use app is always welcome. Nice if it is cheap, or even better, free. The two apps I will talk about here are pretty much "slack" lookalikes, but with a focus on everyone instead of being mainly business/office oriented. I will talk about Discord and Guilded, what they are and what the big differences are between them, and which one I prefer. You might not have heard of Guilded, but most likely you have heard of Discord, the popular app that is used by a variety of people.

                        Discord is a great app with lots and lots of cool and useful features, but it does lock a lot behind a paywall. If it was JUST cosmetics that are being locked behind a paywall, that would be fine, but sadly, decent audio/video/screenshare quality and decent filesharing size is locked behind their "Discord Nitro" subscription service. <br> <br> Nitro (9,99€) offers you those things and cosmetic things like animated profile picture, animated emotes, using emotes globally (outside of the emotes origin Discord server) and more. <br> <br>
                        If you care about audio or video quality, it'll get a bit... pricey.
                        If you want to have a Discord Server with good audio/video/screenshare quality (256kb/s a/v, 1080p60fps screenshare) which requires so called "boosts" you can apply to the server, then you'd have to pay 24,78€ for 7 boosts (3,54€ per boost with Nitro) ontop of Nitro, per month.

                        Guilded is a competitor to Discord. Oh yes! maybe I will put the entire explanation here at some point why Guilded has so much potential, but in a nutshell, most features that discord wants money for, like good audio quality, is free on guilded. Plus, Guilded has a ton of built in things you don't have on discord, like calendar, scheduling, polls, etc.
